# Notes_Making

As part of DotSlash 2020 held at PES Univerisity we created
a NLP based Notes making application that creates written notes out of lecture videos and audios.

NLP is used to find the particular topic about which the lecture is about. 
Then combining the lecture transcript along with information scraped from the web, final notes are generated.
One can input the lecture video/audio through a web app which then gives out the notes.
Flask is used for the frontend/backend integration.
