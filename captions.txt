Q is an abstract Data Structure some words similar to start online Star Q is open at both its one end is always used to insert data and other is used to remove data the queue queue follows first in first out method method method that is the array Titan store was will be accessed first Real world example of cube can be single Lane one way road vehicle interspersed exit for more Real world example can be seen as fuels are detected Windows and bus stops pura presentation as we know understand that make you we access both and Soul different reasons the following diagram given below tries to explain few representation of data structure as a sax ok you can also be implemented using arrays linked list pointers and success for the sake of simplicity we shall implement queue using one dimensional array basic operations operations main wall initialising for defining the cube utilising it and then completely racing memory hey we shall try to understand the basic operations associated with q in Q which means add an item to the cube b cube which means remove an item from the few few more functions are required to make the above mentioned queue operation efficient these are which get the element at the front of the cube without removing it is full which execute is full is empty check the Q is Mt in Q we always DQ the data. The front pointer and while entering data and the Kuwaiti take help of the Year. Its first learn about the supporter functions of a cube this function has to see the front of the tube that was the aim of peek function is a far as follows implementation of P function C programming language as we are using single dimensional array to implement queue we just check for the real pointer to read to reach at Max I said to me that the cube is full in case we met in the queue in a circular linked list algorithm will defer if the value of front is less than me 9 0 it is that the cube is not yet initialised is empty as a C programming code Q maintenance to data. Front and rear therefore its operations are comparatively difficult improvement in the stacks following steps can be taken to include the data into a start with q is it useful produce overflow error and exit exit you is not for increment arrear pointer to find the next empty space add data element that you location weather there is. And return success sometimes you also check to see if PQ is installed or not to handle any unforeseen situations the queue operation accessing data from the Q is a process of two tasks access the data when the front is pointing and remove the date after access the following must must be performed to DQ the operation check in the queue is empty accusantium produced under flow error and exit this is not empty access the database front is pointing payment 1.2.2 the next available data atom return success implementation of frequency programming language user data structures that follow the first in first out that is the first element is added to the queue and be removed
